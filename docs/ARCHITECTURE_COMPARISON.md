# Architecture Comparison: SEI CLOB vs. Competitor DEXs

This document compares the architecture of the current SEI CLOB implementation with prominent Solana-based DEXs.

## 1. Overall Architecture

*   **SEI CLOB:** Implemented in Solidity for the SEI blockchain (EVM-compatible). It features a distinct three-layer architecture:
    *   `Book`: Manages the order book structure and matching logic (intended to be crankless).
    *   `State`: Stores details of individual orders.
    *   `Vault`: Handles user balances, positions, and the settlement process.
    *   It aims for a custody-free design, interacting via token approvals, with custody only taken briefly during settlement within the Vault.
*   **Competitor DEX A (Solana):** Implemented in Rust for Solana. It's designed as a fully on-chain, crankless order book emphasizing atomic settlement.
    *   Architecture seems more integrated, with `program` and `state` modules managing logic and on-chain data (market state, order book) directly within Solana accounts.
*   **Competitor DEX B (Solana):** Implemented in Rust using the Anchor framework for Solana. It evolved from Serum DEX.
    *   Leverages standard Solana account patterns: distinct accounts for Market state, the Order Book (Bids/Asks), and user-specific Open Orders Accounts (OOA).
    *   Openbook V1 (Serum fork) used a crank for settlement; V2 aims for improvements, potentially reducing or eliminating the crank dependency.

## 2. State Management

*   **SEI CLOB:** State is fragmented across contracts: `Book` (order structure), `State` (order details), `Vault` (balances). Synchronization between these contracts is critical.
*   **Competitor DEX A:** Appears to store market and order book state directly within dedicated Solana accounts managed by the program. This allows for efficient reads/writes within Solana's execution model.
*   **Competitor DEX B:** Uses separate accounts for different state aspects (Market, Bids, Asks, Open Orders). This modularity is typical in Solana development, allowing parallel processing and targeted updates.

## 3. Order Book Implementation

*   **SEI CLOB:** `Book.sol` likely uses Solidity mappings and potentially custom data structures to represent the order book. Efficiency depends heavily on the chosen Solidity patterns.
*   **Competitor DEX A:** Code structure suggests efficient on-chain data structures (like trees or heaps) stored within Solana accounts for fast matching.
*   **Competitor DEX B:** Explicit `orderbook` module with `ordertree.rs` strongly indicates a balanced binary search tree (or similar) implementation, optimized for price-time priority matching within Solana accounts.

## 4. Settlement Process

*   **SEI CLOB:** Features an explicit settlement phase managed by the `Vault`. For Symphony integration, a two-stage process exists involving the `SymphonyAdapter`.
*   **Competitor DEX A:** Advertises "atomic settlement," implying matching and asset transfers occur within a single transaction, likely using Cross-Program Invocations (CPIs) to the SPL Token program.
*   **Competitor DEX B:** Settlement in V1/Serum relied on external cranks or separate instructions. V2 likely streamlines this, potentially integrating settlement more closely with matching via CPIs, but the use of Open Orders Accounts might still play a role in managing settled funds or collateral.

## 5. Custody Model

*   **SEI CLOB:** Primarily custody-free, relying on ERC20 `approve`. Temporary custody occurs within the `Vault` during the settlement execution.
*   **Competitor DEX A:** Appears custody-free, interacting directly with user token accounts via CPIs, requiring standard SPL token approvals.
*   **Competitor DEX B:** The presence of `open_orders_account.rs` suggests that, like Serum V3/Openbook V1, users might need to deposit collateral into their OOA, which the program uses for trading and settlement. This differs from the SEI CLOB's goal of avoiding user deposits into the protocol itself.

## Relevance to SEI CLOB Test Failures

The recurring `State: order does not exist` error in `Vault.test.ts` and `VaultFeeCalculation.test.ts` points to a state synchronization issue *within the test setup*. The `Vault` attempts to fetch order details from the `State` contract for fee calculation, but the order isn't found.

*   **Architectural Contrast:** While other DEXs use different state models suited to Solana, the core issue highlighted is the need for consistent state visibility. In the SEI CLOB's layered design, the tests fail to ensure the `State` contract is correctly populated *before* the `Vault` queries it.
*   **Potential Fragility:** The SEI CLOB's separation of concerns (Book, State, Vault) is valid, but it introduces dependencies where one contract relies on the state managed by another. The test failures expose a potential fragility point in this interaction, emphasizing the need for careful state management and synchronization, especially during complex operations like order placement and settlement initiation within the testing environment.
